# ESA Mobile App

## Getting started
To get started with the project, simply clone the project and follow the [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide. This project uses the React Native CLI and *not* the Expo CLI.
Select your OS and what platform you want to build to. **Beware that iOS requires a mac environment.**
